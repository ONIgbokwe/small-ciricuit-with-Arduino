Arduino MCU with sensor for detecting temperatures and controlling LED on or off state

Implementad behaviour:
LED blinks for 30 seconds if temperature > 40°C and ≤ 50°C.
LED is solid for 30 seconds if temperature > 50°C.
After either condition, LED stays off for at least 15 seconds.
The system simulates random temperature reading ranging from 10°C to 55°C every 2 seconds.
